# Clients Manager App 

This app is the final project for the course "Universidad Java" on the `JSP's and Servlets` module.

## How does it works?

Works operating the common web `CRUD` operations, simullating an Web App that manages your business clients.

## Tech

Very simple config: runs linked on a `MySQL8` using the `JDBC Java tech`, served by a `GlassFish` on development stage. 
Front-end it's basically `bootstrap4`.

## How does it looks like?
